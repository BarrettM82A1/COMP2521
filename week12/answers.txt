a.
Maximun lenth is 27
More slots the words distribute widely,which can be indicate by more slots have 1 words.
More slot is empty.

b. Yes, the prime number of table size has less empty slot.
400837 = 46997
400000 = 53533

857137 = 315778
857144 = 317732

I have no confidence of this algorithm can have prefect result in large number.


d.I notice that, for the same input, the different table size could impact
the distribution of hash table which cause the differ of performance. If we 
could found the suitable table size or the perfect hash function, we could 
have a very well performance of the same table or data set.

e. must be 1, inserting every words would be a linear time.

f. Use a better hash function. The key would distribute more evenly between
every slot. In the theory, for every given data set, there is a perfect hash 
fucntion for that data, that would well  distribute the dataset. 
Not use this kind of hash table, Use linear probing with double hashing. By my
experiment in the assignment 2, the search is cost 1 hash most of times.
Which is linear time. But that couldn't show in this stats collection way.
